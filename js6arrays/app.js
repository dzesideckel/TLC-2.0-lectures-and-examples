// adding values to the end of an array

// PUSH

// console.log(numbers);
// numbers.push(7);
// console.log(numbers);
// console.log(numbers.push(88));
// conesole.log(numbers.length);

//  functions when they return values,
//  that return value can come as confirmationn that something was done

//  the functions purpose, is all the steps inside

//  so then numbers.push(88) gives us the length out 
//  when we log it, but when we do it,
//  it doesn't give us anything

//  so every function essentially works differently, 
//  it does stuff, but some of its behaviour is not
//  expected, unless we know what its doing anyway.

// what POP does, is it takes away values.

numbers.pop();
console.log(numbers);
